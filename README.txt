I have done my all coding by using ANACONDA in jupyter.
FIRSTLY you needed to open my main file name #ChatBotSystem.ipynb

HOW TO RUN THIS PROJECT (Rule based ChatBot system of ISMT college)
    
    STEP 1: INSTALL nltk (command = !pip install nltk)
    STEP 2: DOWNLOAD nltk [for chatbot system you can install only book (command = nltk.download() ) ]
    STEP 3: INSTALL numpy (command = !pip install numpy)
    STEP 4: INSTALL tensorflow (command = !pip install tensorflow)
    
    After these all successfully INSTALLED on your laptop or computer you needed to import libraries
    importing libraries are:
        1. import random
        2. import json
        3. import pickle
        4. import numpy as np
        5.import nltk
        6.from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer
        7.from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model
        
    After importing all these libraries RUN below codes by simply clicking RUN given on top on JUPYTER. 
    AND finally project will RUN SUCCESSFULLY.
